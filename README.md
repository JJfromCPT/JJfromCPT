- 👋 Hi, I’m JJ
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and therefore thought coding would be a great start to becoming a Game Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about coding and everything surrounding it and might start with Python first.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not sure how this works or what to colllab on) something I guess.
